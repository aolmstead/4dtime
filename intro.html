		<li><img src="media/COMICS PAGES/INTRO/13.png" alt="A text box reads, After studying comics formalism and philosophy in college (as well as psychoanalysis and dream interpretation), I fatefully ran into a book at a thrift store that changed my life... College-Elk is holding a copy of a book entitled The Fourth Dimension: A Guided Tour of the Higher Universes. The image on the cover is a sort of MC Escher-style cartoon of a man climbing in and out of a block simultaneously, like a sort of optical illusion. On the bottom of the cover it reads, by Rudy Rucekr, Foreward by Martin Gardner. Elk exclaims loudly in a bold speech bubble, Whoah Groovy!"></li
		><li><img src="media/COMICS PAGES/INTRO/14.png" alt="College-Elk is nose-deep in the book with little swirls and stars and planets bouncing around his head. It reads, My first ever introduction to four-dimensionalism articulated in goofy diagrams written (and drawn!) by sci-fi author and mathematician RUDY RUCKER! which is written in big bubble letters. Elk has little hearts in his eyes and is surrounded by images of clocks, watches and sun-dials, and there's a framed portrait of Rudy Rucker behind him. Rudy Rucker is a cute older white man with a big goofy grin and is smiling behind big glasses and is wearing a fly-fisherman bucket hat. Elk says, I'd read a lot on the philosophy of time, but this was the first instance where the theory struck me like a LIGHTNING BOLT."></li
		><li><img src="media/COMICS PAGES/INTRO/15.png" alt="Rucker's goal is to jolt you into shifting your consciousness, using cartoons to help reconsider how you conceive of the fourth dimension- time. Rudy Rucker is shooting thunder bolts from his hands. Like Walter Benjamin's Dialectical Image that shocks you into realization! Below is pictured Walter Benjamin shooting thunder bolts out of his hands while smoking a cigarette, somehow!"></li
		><li><img src="media/COMICS PAGES/INTRO/16.png" alt="In the tradition of Rudy Rucker, 4dtime.space is my attempt to flash you with images to provoke gut insights on the philosophy of time. Pictured: a diagram of the block universe, which is a cube with a plane passing through it, and two points on either end of the cube with a world line passing between the two. There's an arrow pointed at the first dot, labelled YOU! The plane in the center that's passing through the block universe is labelled Jetztzeit or now-time. Elk is below the diagram pointing at a reel of film and a comic book with its pages open to reveal bare panels, and he says, Specifically, shock you using comics and film formalism as guide."></li
		><li><img src="media/COMICS PAGES/INTRO/Addin_1.png" alt="Elk is dressed up as an old-timey philosopher with a big ruff and a flouncy hat with a big feather in it, and he's holding a skull dramatically. He says, While there is scholarship on comics form and content, the comics medium itself is rarely used to make truth claims. Scott McCloud appears and says, Hey! If you want to understand comics, I wrote the book AND drew it! Elk replies, but it can't just be you! In the next panel, it reads: Alison Bechdel certainly does some psychoanalytic snooping in Are You My Mother, but most consider that work to be italicized JUST a memoir. Pictured beside this frame is a redrawn panel from Are You My Mother where Alison Bechdel has a worried look and is laying down on the couch in a therapy session."></li

		><li><img src="media/COMICS PAGES/INTRO/addin_3.png" alt="Elk blushes, saying, As a trans philosopher and autobiographical comics artist, of course I'm interested in the question what is the self and how a subject persists through time! He is surrounded by a tiny trans pride flag, the gay inverted triangle, and a gender symbol that has the trans male/female symbol, non-binary x symbol, and a question mark branching out from it. He also is adorned with a little banner that reads his pronouns, which are he, him, and his. Next, in a big text box, reads: Knowing how spacetime is structured analogically through comics formalism is a window into an everyday awareness of how time functions. In the next, final panel, Elk looks sheepish at his laptop, waving his hand. He says, Don't worry if this all sounds super obscure... Just click the home button and start exploring! And thanks for reading."></li
