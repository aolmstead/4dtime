<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/CORPUS/corpus hypercubus_1.png" alt="Title: Corpus Hypercubus: Painted by Salvador Dali. In the center of the frame Elk is being crucified on net hypercube, mimicing the original painting. He says, In the original painting, Jesus is being crucified on what appears to be a net hypercube, or, a hypercube unfolded to create 8 regular cubes in the shape of a cross. Elk is also playing the role of Dali's wife and Mary Magdalene who is in the bottom left corner of the painting wearing a long robe. Elk turns back to the viewer and says, God, an infinite being that exists outside of space and time, is embodied in Christ, a finite human, just as this 3D man is pinned to a 4D cross. Here, the use of the hypercube implies Christ's transcendence of space and time in the act of his crucifixion. The hypercube is our attempt at understanding higher dimensions, just as God's physical presence on Earth in Jesus was meant to convey/contain his infinite love..." width="1000">
<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/CORPUS/on the alchemy of things.png" alt="Next, Elk is holding up a zine called On Alchemy and the Timing of Things, by Brian Cotnoir. He says, Another interpretation of the Christian mythos that has been brought to my attention through the zines of Brian Cotnoir is that Christian theology is, at core, encapsulated in a trinity of the three modes of time: that the past, present, and future are figured in the creation, the fall, and the redemption. Cotnoir comments: it is as if all time past and future is contained in an eternal now, a feeling that is captured in Corpus Hypercubus. It places Christ outside of time, the Eternal Now of his crucifixion an ultimate expression of the timelessness of the diviine, the placement of the future as object of Christian desire out of human reach. As in John 14:6, No one comes to the father but through me. The image to the right of this speech bubble shows an all-seeing eye labeled God: the Eternal Now looming over planet earth, that is split down the middle. On the left side is the tree of knowledge, which is labeled The Past, with a subtitle that reads Eden, Purity, and Innocence. On the right side is The Present, the planet looking like a desert, with the subtitle The Fall, Sin, and Suffering. Hovering to the right of Earth is a cloud labeled The Future, with the subtitle Heaven, Absolution, and Rest. The narration continues: Corpus Hypercubus gives us a glimpse of the four-dimensional Christian worldview that Christ represents from the point of the eternal now of Heaven, perhaps so that we may not have to die in order to see it ourselves. This bubble is next to an panel of Jesus being crucified labeled Crucifixion, where the shadow of the cross falls on an inverted image of Jesus drawn in white labeled Ascension, where the shadow of the cross is labeled Liberation from Time." width="1000">
